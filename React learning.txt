React JS:

What is react:
    * React is an open source front-end Javascript library for building user interfaces.
    * React is used to build single-page applications.
    * React allow us to create reusable UI components.

JSX:
    * JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
    * JSX allow us to write HTML in React.
    * JSX makes it easier to create React elements and components visually.


React ES6:
    * ES6 stands for ECMAScript 6 (European Computer Manufacturers Association).
    * React uses ES6 features like classes, arrow functions and destructuring to write modern , clean and efficient code.

Components:
    * Components are independent and reusable bits of code for create the user interface.
    * We can use multiple components into a single component.
    Components are two types:
    * Class components:
        A class compoent must include the extends React.Compoent statement.
        Use this.state for managing local state and lifecycle methods.
        This component requires a render() method, this method returns HTML.
    * Function componets:
        A function component literally defined as Javascript functions.
        Functional compoent also returns HTML.
        Primarily used in modern React due to simplicity and the power of hooks.

Props:
    * Props stands for Properties.
    * Props are used to pass the data from a parent component to child component.
    * They are read only and cannot be modeified by receiving component.
    * Props are immutable.
    * Follow a undirectional data flow parent to child.

State:
    * State is a built-in object in React used to store dynamic data that affects a component's rendering.
    * Unlike Props, state is mutable and can be updated using the setState function in class components or useState Hook in functional components.
    * Change in state update the UI automatically.

Event:
    * React events handle user interactions like clicks, typing or form submissions.
    * They are similar to HTML events but use camelCale name.
    * Use the event object to access event details.

Lists:
    * Lists in React are used to render multiple items dynamically, typically using the map() function.
    * Each list item must have a unique key prop to help React identify and update items effiently.
